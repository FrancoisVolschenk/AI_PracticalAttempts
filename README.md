# AI_PracticalAttempts
An assortment of programs showcasing AI algorithms that I learnt at university and for fun

## Genetic Algorithm - Shakespeare
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem
The project is based off of the idea that a monkey seated at a typewriter, given infinite time will eventually type out the full works of Shakespeare

## K-Means Clustering
A simple project used to visualize clustering using the Euclidean distance formula.

## MinMax Tic Tac Toe
The classic game of Xs and Os. The agent uses the Minimax algorithm to plan its next move

## NeuralNet_FromScratch
This is my attempt at creating a neural network capable of supervised learning from scratch.

## Q-Learning(Predator Prey)
This project is based off of my idea for the semester long project I am doing for AI.
An intelligent agent is placed in a world where a predator is constantly chasing it. The agent needs to learn how to escape from the predator, while also finding food. The agent has a limited amount of energy that is replenished once it has eaten. 

This version does not have the predator, and uses Q-Learning to find food as opposed to my semester project where it uses a neural network.

## Q-LearningMazeSolver
This project ises Q-Learning to find its way through a maze
