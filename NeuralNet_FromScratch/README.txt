This neural network was created by following along the video playlist on the coding train youtube channel regarding neural networks

The main.py file contains a small program to train the neural network to peform the XOR operation
1 && 1 == 0
0 && 1 == 1
0 && 0 == 0
1 && 0 == 1

but if you have proper data representation, theoretically the network should be able to learn more complex problems as well

The network is currently fixed at 3 layers: Input, Hidden and Output, and the backpropagation algorithm is hard coded to only correct two layer's worth of wights
But feel free to extend functionality as an exercise
